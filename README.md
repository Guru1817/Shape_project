# 🟦 Shape Project (Java)

This project demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Java through a simple **Shape Management System**.  
It includes different shape classes (like Circle, Rectangle, Square, etc.) and calculates their **area** and **perimeter**.

---

🚀 Features
- Implementation of **abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism**
- Separate classes for different shapes (e.g., Circle, Rectangle, Square)
- Calculates **area** and **perimeter** dynamically
- Easy to extend by adding new shapes
- Console-based interactive program

---

🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Java (JDK 8+)**
- **OOP principles** (Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism)

 ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
 .....bash
    git clone https://github.com/Guru1817/Shape_project.git

2. Navigate to the folder:
   cd Shape_project
3. Compile the Java files:
   javac src/*.java
4.Run the program:
   java src.Main
 📸 Example Output

   Choose a shape:
1. Circle
2. Rectangle
3. Square

Enter your choice: 1
Enter radius: 5

Area of Circle = 78.5
Perimeter of Circle = 31.4
    1. Circle
